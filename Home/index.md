  <strong>Short Bio:</strong> 
I began my postdoctoral research in Applied Mathematics at Louisiana State University in 2023. Prior to this, I completed two Ph.D. programs at Mississippi State University: 
one in Engineering at <a href="https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/">The High Performance Computing Center </a> in 2022, 
and another in Applied Mathematics at  <a href="https://www.math.msstate.edu/">the Mathematics Department </a>the Mathematics Department in 2024.
