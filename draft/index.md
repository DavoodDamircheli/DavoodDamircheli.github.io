### About

I am the Morton E. Gurtin Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), scientific machine learning, and PDE-constrained optimization.

**Research Highlight:** See [this press release](#) about my work on machine learning and black holes!

**Short Bio:** Before coming to Brown, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](#) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Before that, I was a postdoc at the [Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics](#). Before that, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Analysis at the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by [Barbara Wohlmuth](#). Before that, I was a Ph.D. student at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences](#), where I was supervised by [Leszek Demkowicz](#).
